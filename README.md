# Hello world docker action

As per Newrelic
> Deploying an app can be a risky eventâ€”when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts.

This action adds a deployment marker to your application graphs on Newrelic and a new deployment to be recorded in your application.
